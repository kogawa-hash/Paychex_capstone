# Paychex Capstone

Model Development:

Gather Job title informations (performance metrics, subgroup analysis)
Join the different tables on appropriate values (probably a network of employees with employer information)
Main focus: developing a graphical neural network
Try out multilabel classification approaches such as CNN
Plan to use Blue Hive\pytorch for developing the models
Goal: To make a predictive model for user job titles using available user data. 

Data Exploratory Analysis/ Data Preprocessing:

Merge data
Handle null values 
Correlation analysis 
Pandas profiling 
Summary Statistics 
Explore job label distribution 
Explore industry density
Salary summary statistics per industry
Graph formation 

Why GNN:

Especially good for complex data sets
Scalable for large datasets
Could be useful for creating helpful visualizations
More Interpretable than other deep learning approaches
Specifically ‘suggested’ by Paychex team
